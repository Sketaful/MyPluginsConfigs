# ========================================================================================================
# ATTENTION: if you want to make changes to the sblocale files, remember:
# 1. Don't remove the internal variable anchors, like [#0] and [#1]. Note that these anchors are for SignBoard internal use only.
# 2. Changing COMMAND NAMES here WILL NOT change them in the game!
# 3. The files must be saved with UTF-8 encoding, or you'll lose your accented characters.
# 4. You can use all of Minecraft's codes for text color and formatting, which are:
#    0 = black; &1 = dark blue; &2 = dark green; &3 = dark aqua; &4 = dark red; &5 = dark purple; &6 = gold; &7 = grey; &8 = dark grey; &9 = blue; &a = green; &b = aqua; &c = red; &d = light purple; &e = yellow; &f = white; &k = magic; &l = bold; &m = strikethrough; &n = underline; &o = italic; &r = reset
# 5. You CAN use the files to translate user-created boards; simply follow the   original: translation   model for each line (don't forget the space after the colon, and there can't be anything after the closing " in each line).
# 6. You can also create sblocale files for new languages, but you must follow these instructions:
#    - All file names must begin with "sblocale_" and end with ".yml"; whatever is in-between is the language code.
#    - The first two lines of the file (after these instructions) must be language_desc and language_code.
#    - For the language code, try to use two letters for the language (following ISO-639) and two letters for the country (following ISO-3166), with no hyphen in-between.
#    - ... if you do this, "Brazilian Portuguese" becomes "ptBR" and Espa√±ol Argentino becomes "esAR".
#    - You can easily look up these codes at https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13214_01/wli/docs92/xref/xqisocodes.html.
# 7. New versions of SignBoard will include new sblocale files that will always follow the naming convention described above.
# 8. New versions of SignBoard will include new sblocale files that WILL NOT OVERWRITE the custom ones you've created. If you wish use the SignBoard files instead, delete existing ones and SignBoard will create new ones.
# 9. If you (completely) translate any sblocale file to a new language, please feel free to submit it to us for inclusion in SignBoard :-).
